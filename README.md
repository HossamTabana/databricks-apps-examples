# Databricks Apps Examples

## Background

[Click here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Equ7PBeM-Mw) for a walkthrough of Databricks Apps!

Databricks Apps provides a new modality of serving data and AI applications on the Databricks Intelligence Platform. In general, application-views are particularly impactful to businesses because they truly _democratize data intelligence_. Meaning, even the _least technical_ of business analysts are able to unlock the full value of their organization's data stack with the power of slick, frontend applications.

Databricks Apps (on release in October 2024) support a variety of Python data application frameworks, including:
- Flask
- Dash
- FastAPI
- Gradio
- Streamlit
- _and many more..._

## What is this repository?

Databricks staffs over 2,000 talented, technical Solution Architects with a variety of expertises. Our Solution Architects will place their most interesting, compelling, and implementable applications here so that you, the Databricks user, can easily access and try them out on your end.

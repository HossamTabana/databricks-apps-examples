# Databricks Apps Examples

## Background

[Click here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Equ7PBeM-Mw) for a walkthrough of Databricks Apps!

Databricks Apps provides a new modality of serving data and AI applications on the Databricks Intelligence Platform. In general, application-views are particularly impactful to businesses because they truly _democratize data intelligence_. Meaning, even the _least technical_ of business analysts are able to unlock the full value of their organization's data stack with the power of slick, frontend applications.

Databricks Apps (on release in October 2024) support a variety of Python data application frameworks, including:
- Flask
- Dash
- FastAPI
- Gradio
- Streamlit
- _and many more..._
